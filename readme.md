# Melanoma and Nevus Segmentation and Classification Project

## Overview

This project applies advanced machine learning techniques for the segmentation and classification of melanoma and nevus. It's divided into two main parts: CNN classification using ResNet50 and UNet-based segmentation followed by SVM classification.

## Goal

The goal is to provide a tool for early detection and diagnosis of skin cancers, aiding healthcare professionals.

## Features

- **ResNet50 CNN**: Classify skin lesions as melanoma or nevus.
- **UNet Segmentation**: Segment skin cancer lesions.
- **SVM Classification**: Classify extracted features from segmented images.

## Technologies

- Deep Learning (CNN, UNet)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Image Processing (Color Analysis, Entropy)
